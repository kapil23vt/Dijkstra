# Dijkstra
Implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm using BFS and Queue

The input is to be entered as follows.
For example, consider the network where (1) is directly connected to (2) and (3). (2) and (3) are directly connected. (2) and (3) are directly connected.

Enter the number of queries. For example = 1

Enter the number of nodes and edges in the network. Here nodes are 4 and edges are 4

Enter the starting node and ending node for each of the edge. 
These will be entered as [1 2] [2 4] [1 3] and [2 3].

Enter the node from which the minimum distance to other nodes is to be found.

Enter the starting node. 
If you enter [2], you will get output as 

The minimum distace to the other nodes :
Node 1 Minimum Distance = 1
Node 3 Minimum Distance = 1
Node 4 Minimum Distance = 1
